Asymco has done a fascinating piece of research mapping technology adoption curves, technology refresh rates, and human lifespan, to predict technology lifetime ownership.

Please go to [Asymco](http://www.asymco.com/2013/11/19/a-way-to-measure-ones-life/) to read the full article - it is worth the time.
