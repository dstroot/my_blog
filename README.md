### The most important aspects are:
1. It is based on the static site generation tool [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

  > My preference would be a nodejs equivalent tool since you have
  > to install Ruby/Ruby Gems to use Jekyll but _sigh_ oh well...

2. It uses the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) front-end framework for layout and design.
3. It uses [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) to manage the assets.  I went to the trouble of doing this so I could select exactly what parts of Bootstrap I wanted to use.  An easier and more direct route might be to use the [Bootstrap customizer](http://getbootstrap.com/customize/).

### Technical Dependencies
* You need Nodejs installed mainly because we need to use NPM to install things.
* You need Ruby and RubyGems
  * `bundle install`
* You need gulp installed `npm install -g gulp`

#### Build Tooling

* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)
* [Nodejs](http://nodejs.org/)
* [gulpjs](http://gulpjs.com/)
* [Bower](http://bower.io/)

Bower has one minor quirk that you need to be aware of – it will install components into a “bower_components” directory by default, which unfortunately is not under the public directory. I suggest you create a directory called “lib” under “public” You can do this by running the command `mkdir public/lib` Next, in the app directory, create a plain text file called “.bowerrc” that contains:

`{ "directory" : "public/lib" }`

This configuration file will tell Bower to install tools into the “public/lib” directory.

### Steps to build and deploy
1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `bower install`
4. Run `gulp`.  This does a lot of work:
   * Processes the .js
       * Runs [jshint](http://www.jshint.com/) on the .js source files
       * Concatenates the .js source files
       * Minifies the resulting concatenated file using Uglifyjs.
    * Processes the [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) files to CSS
       * Minifies the resulting CSS file.
5. Fire it up!  Run `jekyll serve` or `jekyll serve -w`

## Setting up a site or blog (high level)

There is actually quite a few things to do even for a simple site:
* Obtain a domain
  * Reserve Twitter name
  * Reserve Facebook name
  * Reserve Google+ name
  * etc.
* Move the domain DNS to AWS
* Setup hosting (I'm using AWS S3 and Cloudfront since this is a static site)
* Setup [Google Apps](http://www.google.com/enterprise/apps/business/) hosting for email
* Setup Mailchimp for newsletter signups
* Setup Disqus for site comments
* Setup Google Analytics
* Setup feedburner for rss/atom feed syndication (still need to figure out how to get feed subscribers over to mailchimp so I have one email list...)
* Setup NewRelic or Pingdom for uptime monitoring
